# py_utils
Python utils collection, on my own style.

For sure most of the utils here exists as standalone-packages, but is fun to
have something self-build :).

## Utilites

* bashCMD: Launch & manage Bash commands.
* bashScript: Set and Launch bash scripts. Sits on the top of bashCMD.
* gitProject: Gather Git information of a Path.
* logger: My simply logger.
* meta: MetaClass to compend all the utilites for all the object definitions.
* controllers: 3-layers controllers definitions, using logger and other stuff.
* utils_py: Collection of methods to shortcut stuff. 


## Testing

Unit testing using **unittest** is defined at the tests package
